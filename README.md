## Overview
This is a basic dashboard project that's part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal of this project is to practice creating a simple dashboard layout with light and dark mode functionality.

## Features
- **Light and Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes to see how the design adapts.
- **Simple Layout**: The dashboard includes a sidebar, header, and a main content area to help you get familiar with structuring a web page.

## What I Learned

- Basic HTML and CSS layout techniques.
- A bit of JavaScript to toggle between themes.
